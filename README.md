VJTavSplitViewController - Minimal and easiest implementation of UISplitViewController inside UITabBarController
================

Inspired by [IntelligentSplitViewController](https://github.com/grgcombs/IntelligentSplitViewController) and [APSplitViewController](https://github.com/SlavaBushtruk/APSplitViewController) I decided to create an implementation of UISplitViewController inside UITabBarController which supports auto orientation and any orientation at the start.

The above implementations are really good but they are complicated and are either using custom classes heavily. I have tried to implement minimal amount custom code and achieve the same functionality.

Support
================
iOS 5 only for now due to its StoryBoarding and ARC features
