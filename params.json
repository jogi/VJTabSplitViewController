{"name":"VJTavSplitViewController","body":"VJTavSplitViewController\r\n================\r\n**Minimal and easiest implementation of UISplitViewController inside UITabBarController**\r\n\r\nInspired by [IntelligentSplitViewController](https://github.com/grgcombs/IntelligentSplitViewController) and [APSplitViewController](https://github.com/SlavaBushtruk/APSplitViewController) I decided to create an implementation of UISplitViewController inside UITabBarController which supports auto orientation and any orientation at the start of the application(not just portrait).\r\n\r\nThe above implementations are really good but they are complicated and are using custom classes heavily. I have tried to implement minimal amount of custom code and achieve the same functionality.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n================\r\niOS 5 only for now due to its StoryBoarding and ARC features\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n================\r\n[Under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\r\n\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n================\r\nVashishtha Jogi ([@jvashishtha](http://github.com/jvashishtha)).\r\n\r\nSupport or Contact\r\n================\r\nHaving trouble?
